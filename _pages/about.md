I am interested in the mechanisms driving evolution and adaptation in natural populations living under extreme conditions. I am currently enrolled at the Doctoral Program in Biodiversity, Genetics and Evolution (Biodiv) at the University of Porto (UP) and in parternship with CIBIO-InBIO (Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources). I was awarded a mixed PhD scholarship by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) which has allowed me to conduct research both at my home institution (UP) and be hosted by the Department of Integrative Biology at UC-Berkeley.   


During my PhD at CIBIO-InBIO, in collaboration with the Nielsen Lab at UC-Berkeley, I have been applying an interdisciplinary approach to assess the relative roles of demography and natural selection in the evolution of North African desert-dwelling fox species. By integrating ecological and evolutionary aspects of these species we expect to: i) identify and characterize the functional roles of the most relevant genes involved in adaptation to extreme arid conditions, ii) provide insights into the historical events responsible for adaptation and evolution in deserts.




I did both my BSc and MSc in biology at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto.  My thesis focused on using both ancient and modern DNA sequencing methods to study the past and present genetic diversity of critically endangered species.



My research questions are as follows:  How can certain species survive in extreme harsh environments, harbouring extraordinary adaptations, when others are nearly extinct? What is the molecular basis of these adaptations? I have now the opportunity to address these questions during my PhD at CIBIO-InBIO where, in collaboration with UC-Berkeley, I am currently applying an interdisciplinary approach to assess the relative roles of demography and natural selection in the evolution of North African desert-dwelling fox species. By integrating ecological and evolutionary aspects of these species with cutting edge genomic tools, we expect to: i) identify and characterize the functional roles of the most relevant genes involved in adaptation to extreme arid conditions, ii) provide insights into the historical events responsible for adaptation and evolution in deserts.
