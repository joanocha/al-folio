Hello! 

I am an evolutionary geneticist interested in the mechanisms driving evolution and adaptation in natural populations living under extreme conditions.

Currently I am at my 4th year of PhD, working on the genetic basis of desert adaptation, co-advised by [Raquel Godinho](https://cibio.up.pt/people/details/mrgodinho) at the University of Porto and by [Rasmus Nielsen](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/rasmus-nielsen) at UC Berkeley. 

When I am not doing research, I swim,  or surf, or hike, or dance. Above all, I enjoy being in close contact with nature.
