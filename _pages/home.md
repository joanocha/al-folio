I am an evolutionary geneticist interested in the mechanisms driving adaptation in natural populations living under extreme conditions.

Currently I am at my 4th year of the [Doctoral Programme in Biodiversity, Genetics and Evolution](https://www.biodiv.pt/en/phd-programme/about/) at CIBIO-InBIO & Department of Biology at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto.  During these past couple of years I have been working on the genetic basis of desert adaptation, co-advised by [Raquel Godinho](https://cibio.up.pt/people/details/mrgodinho) at CIBIO-InBIO/UP and by [Rasmus Nielsen](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/rasmus-nielsen) at UC Berkeley. 

When I am not doing research, I am swimming, surfing, hiking, and dancing (my life before the pandemic). Above all, I enjoy being in close contact with nature and share all the amazing wonders our planet has to offer with the people I love.
